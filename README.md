## Project Details

Keras (Backend: TF) implementation of FashionSiameseCapsNet

Base code for Capsule architecture: [XifengGuo](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras), [birdortyedi](https://github.com/birdortyedi/fashion-caps-net)

Dataset: DeepFashion contains 290K training, 40K validation and 40K test images with 46 fine-grained category labels for clothing images
