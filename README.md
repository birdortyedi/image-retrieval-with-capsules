## Project Details

Keras (Backend: TF) implementation of SCCapsNet and RCCapsNet

Base code for Capsule architecture: [XifengGuo](https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras), [birdortyedi](https://github.com/birdortyedi/fashion-caps-net)

Dataset: 

Large-scale Fashion Recognition and Retrieval (DeepFashion) Dataset. ~50K In-Shop image pairs with 23 fine-grained categories.
